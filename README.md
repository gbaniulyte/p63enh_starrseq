STARR-seq data processing and figure generation for p63 regulatory element MPRA
===========================

All data was processed using python 3.10

This is a collection of notebooks that shows how I processed STARR-seq data
and generated figures for the upcoming publication: 
"Crosstalk between paralogs and isoforms influences p63-dependent regulatory element activity"
